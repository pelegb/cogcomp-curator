These scripts have been set up to simplify moving/creating Curator instances.
They all assume that they are run from a directory containing the file
"curatorVars.sh", which specifies required variables. 

Many of them use the script 'runIt.pl', which renames the process identifier
in a way that makes searching for it easier; this enables the Server Monitor
to more reliably find and kill only the relevant processes for Curator
components.
