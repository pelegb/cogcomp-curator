NO SOURCE REQUIRED
handler, server class is in main wikifier jar

As CURATOR COMPONENT, use DEMO.xml


YOU MUST HAVE A GUROBI LICENSE AVAILABLE FOR THE MACHINE YOU RUN THIS 
USING RELATIONAL INFERENCE



DATA resources must be unpacked, and the paths in config/WikifierNER.config 
and config/DEMO.xml must be changed to match


NOTE:
The Demo Wikifier may behave differently from the standalone instance. The Wikifier has its own internal NER, and I believe this is ignored when run as 
a curator component, when it uses the dependency declared for it in the
annotators.xml file of the Curator instance.



todo: maven project for handler, declare wikifier dependency for automatic build
run script can invoke maven just as SFV script does, to handle dependencies


configs:
NER.config
jwnl_properties.xml
STAND_ALONE_GUROBI.xml
